# AWS Deadline Cloud for VRED

AWS Deadline Cloud for VRED is a Python package that supports creating and running Autodesk VRED jobs within [AWS Deadline Cloud][deadline-cloud].
It provides both the implementation of a VRED plug-in for your workstation that helps you offload the computation for your rendering workloads
to [AWS Deadline Cloud][deadline-cloud] to free up your workstation's compute for other tasks, and the implementation of a command-line
adaptor application based on the [Open Job Description (OpenJD) Adaptor Runtime][openjd-adaptor-runtime] that improves AWS Deadline Cloud's
ability to run VRED efficiently on your render farm.
